üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm rawSalmon01101 (also going by the alias "Diarmait" sometimes, as in the profile), a passionate Java programmer based in India. My journey in the world of code began when I discovered the magic of HTML and CSS in seventh grade; weird, I know! Then came java in eighth grade. Since then, I‚Äôve been on nothing short of a full blown quest for building programs to help others.

üåü Some things I love tinkering with:

Languages I absolutely despise: JavaScript and JavaScript (because my decade old Samsung needs to run it as well!)

‚å®Ô∏è When I‚Äôm not typing away, you‚Äôll find me sipping coffee, exploring open-source projects, or contemplating the mysteries of asynchronous programming. Oh, and I‚Äôm always up for a good tech chat‚Äî hit me up if you want to discuss the latest trends or debate Web apps or native apps!

Feel free to explore my repositories‚Äî oh wait there's only one ü•¥

Alright, that's the end of it! Hope you find gold in my otherwise trash-ridden repos. Keep coding!
